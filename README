Remote ollama server "client/front-end" for ollama API via a VPN(Hamachi). 
Allows for:
-User-centric interaction
-remote model pull/delete
-remote model generate/chat/embeddings calls
-remote model creation via modelFile upload

servers handle all ollama interaction internally
clients just update server modelfiles 

currently hamachi_manager is linux only
hamachi manager needs "path" --cli to run hamachi commands

csv for logs
json for modelfiles #Reconfigure data folder

UI should:
- show models available (size)
- show server CPU usage - pie chart
- show server memory usage - pie chart

- show server storage- candle bar graph
- show jobs running/ jobs completed/failed - jobs sidebar
- jobs window
- (logs window) show logs from serverlog.csv - logs window
- have a command panel to send commands to the server

Issue:
- load_config runs multiple times
